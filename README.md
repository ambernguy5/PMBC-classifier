# PMBC-classifier

This repository contains Colab notebooks for two projects:
1. An autoencoder to reconstruct and visualize latent space log RNA counts data of Peripheral Mononuclear Blood Cells (PMBC) using PCA and TSNE.
2. Trained RandomForest and AdaBoost classifiers to classify between 10 labeled types of PMBCs from log RNA count data (acheived 80% accuracy).
